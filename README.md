# CS408 - Lab 11

Author: Lucas Berry

## Overview

This project serves as an item inventory application which is directly connected to
the AWS API we created in the previous lab assignment. The user can use the form to add
items to the database table through specifying an ID, Name, and Price for the item. Once the user is ready to view the table they can press the Load All Items button to see the contents. If nothing is in the table, the table will remain empty.

To run the application, begin by typing the following into the terminal:

```
npm install
```

After that run the index.html file to see the website. You can check the DynamoDB table
on AWS to verify the items are being added/removed correctly.
